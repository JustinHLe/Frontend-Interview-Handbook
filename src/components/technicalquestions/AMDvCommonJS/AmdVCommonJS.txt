First, a module in Javascript is a file containing related code.
We can import and export modules to share functionality between different modules

CommonJS is a way of importing and exporting modules throughout the application
CommonJS wraps each module in a function called require() and includes an object called module.exports 
which exports the code you want to use in another module

All the developer has to do is add the file you want on to the module.exports object and require the module in the 
dependent file

For example

file1.js
exports.myFunction = () => { console.log("hi) }

file2.js
const obj = require("./file1.js")
obj.myFunction()
