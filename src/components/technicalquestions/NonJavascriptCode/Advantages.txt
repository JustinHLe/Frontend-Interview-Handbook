Writing javascript code in a non javascript language such as typescript can be beneficial because 

there may be features in that language that provide better functionality
Syntatic sugar on top of normal javascript
Better Error Handling

Disadvantages

Requires a javascript processor to compile non native language to javascript
Learning Curve
Dependencies may be harder to find for the exact language
not always up to date with the latest javascript
