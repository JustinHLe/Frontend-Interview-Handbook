/*
    DOMContentLoaded is fired when HTML is loaded and parsed before all stylesheets and images finish loading

    window load event will fire after DOM and all resources and asssets are loaded


    DOMContentLoaded is useful for when we want to call an endpoint and fetch some data since it's not dependent on
    styles or images unless the endpoint contains images

    window load is more practical when all the content is loaded
