/*
    An anonymous function is a function declared without a name

    Anonymous functions can be used as callback functions in a map or setTimeout to keep code contained and readable
    instead of using a named function where we pass the named function in the callback or setTimeout and have to 
    find it in the code

    Anonymous functions can be used as an IIFE to encapsulate variables the current scope of the function not the outer scope
