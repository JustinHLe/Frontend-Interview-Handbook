specificity is the score that determines which styles are applied on to an element, specificity is calculated on every CSS element
important will override all specificity

Elements with higher specificty will have their styles displayed

CSS reads from top to bottom if there are two overlapping styles the "more bottom" style will be applied
Overlapping meaning the style names are exactly the same



Specificity is evaluated from four different numbers

0               0   0                                  0
inline styles   id  classes                            generic element selectors
                    attribute selectors [type="radio"] pseudo elements ::before ::placeholder, things with double colons
                    pseudo classes :hover :nth-child  


[type="password"], // 0 0 1 0
input:focus, // 0 0 1 1
:root #myApp input:required { // 0 1 2 1
  color: blue;
}

Note the * selector and :where() specificity are both 0 0 0
Combinators such as > + ~ "" and || dont add any weight to specificity
