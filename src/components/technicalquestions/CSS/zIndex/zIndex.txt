z-index affects how elements are stacked on the dom. ZIndex only affects elements that have a position value that is not sticky

By default without zIndex elements are stacked in order at which they appear in the dom


A stacking context is just a fancy way of saying that elements children elements will NEVER stack on top of sibling elements
A sibling element is not a child element but rather an element that is within the same row level in the DOM tree

For example

if there are two elements in the dom tree with zIndexes the one with the higher zIndex will stack on top of the other
However if one of those elements has a children with a massively insane zIndex the zIndex will be negligible since the children will never stack on top of 
sibling elements.
