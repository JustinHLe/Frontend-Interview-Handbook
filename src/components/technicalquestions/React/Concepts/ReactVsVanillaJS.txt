React Pros

- React is primarily used for building out larger applications.
- React allows the developer to compartmentalize their code so everything
isn't in one big file
- React encapsulates all the js, html, and css into one place so we dont
have to to grab it from different files called components speeds up 
processing and compiling time since everything is only in one file  
- React code is generated with javascript into one HTML file

Pros of Vanilla JS  

- Fast and simple to develop 
- Javascript is good for simple projects 

Downgrades of Vanilla Javascript

- Data is separated from javascript file, need to fetch Elements every time
- Vanilla Javascript is slow since we have to select all elements 
from the DOM in order to manipulate them
- HTML, CSS, and JS are separated -> need to fetch what we want to 
manipulate and then update then return the data 
- Data is also separated, fetch data from HTML with javascript
