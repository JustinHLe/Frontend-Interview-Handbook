    use strict is a term that is used to enable 'strict mode' in an entire script or in a function

    use strict is used by putting the keyword at the top of the global script to enable use strict everywhere or at the top
    of a function to limit use strict to the function's scope


    Advantages of use strict
    - forces variables to be declared with var let or const
    - Cannot delete variables
    - unique function parameters name
    - cannot write to readable objects
    - throw errors when trying to delete undeletable properties

    Disadvantages
    - not may developers are used to coding in strict mode
    - merging scripts with non strict mode and strict mode
