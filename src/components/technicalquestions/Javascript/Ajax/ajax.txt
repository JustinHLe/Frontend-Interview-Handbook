Ajax is a set of web development techniques that allow for asynchronicity on the client side

In simpler terms it basically allows the user to fetch from the server and have updated content without reloading the page

Ajax allows web applications to send and retrieve data from the server asynchronously without interfering with the 
display or behavior of the page
