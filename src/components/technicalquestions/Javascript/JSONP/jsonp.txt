JSONP allows the browser to make cross domain requests

Normally we cannot make cross domain requests

https://example.com cannot make a request to https://example.net

To make a cross domain requests we have to allow cross domain boundaries

To bypass cross domain requests we can use CORS or use a script tag

When a browser requests to a server with JSONP enabled, the server will accept some type of parameter 
and will send a response formatted in a way where the data can be extracted from the script tag

For example we could send a request to http://www.example.net/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback with the parameter callback

Perhaps without the callback param we would get a normal JSON response, however with JSONP the server recognizes that
we should send something back that is a little different. 

JSONP might send back mycallback({name: "justin"})

and on the client side we could have a function declared called myCallback(data) which does some data handling

JSONP is outdated now use CORS lol
