Feature Detection is the process of checking if the browser supports a certain block of code 
if it does support the code run the code with the Feature
else 
Write the code in a way that is acceptable to the browser

Feature detection is beneficial because we can catch errors and handle them instead of throwing a page errors

for example

if('geolocation' in navigator){
    //handle browsers with geolocation
} else {
    //implement some sort of geoloation for browsers that dont have the geolocation key in navigator
}

Feature Interference checks for feature similar to feature detection but once a feature is detected it will assume
all other features are available as well

for example

if(document.getElementbyTagName){ //checks for document.getElementbyTagName
    document.getElementById("hi")
    //if window has getElementbyTagName assumes window also has getElementById("hi")
}


UA string contains metadata about the browser and can be accessed with navigator.userAgent
UA string is not helpful to use since the metadata is hard to parse and can be spoof
spoofing meaning the data can actually be modified to represent something that is not
